## Hangman
Simple Hangman text-based game written in Python.

*Note:* You will need at least **Python 3** to run this file.

The Hangman class will randomly pick a word from the default text file or a provided text file. Go into your containing folder and run the command `python hangman.py` to get the program started. You can provide an additional argument after running the file, like so: `python hangman.py test.txt` where *test.txt* would be the path to your text file.

You have 6 lives. Head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg. If you so desire more lives, on line `50`, set the `lives` variable to whatever you wish.
